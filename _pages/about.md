I'm a final year Ph.D. student from [Department of Data Science, College of Computing](https://www.ds.cityu.edu.hk), [City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk), under the supervison of [Prof. Yining Dong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/Yining.Dong.htm).

Prior to studying at CityUHK, I was supervised by Prof. Gang Yu and received the M.Eng. degree from the [School of Robotics and Advanced Manufacture](http://sram.hitsz.edu.cn/xygk/xyld.htm), [Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen (HIT)](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn), Shenzhen, China, in 2022. Earlier, I received the B.Eng. degree from the [College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering](https://mve.cqu.edu.cn), [Chongqing University (CQU)](https://www.cqu.edu.cn), Chongqing, China, in 2019.
