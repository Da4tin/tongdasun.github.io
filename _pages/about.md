I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Data Science](https://www.ds.cityu.edu.hk), [City University of Hong Kong]. My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yining Dong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/Yining.Dong.htm).

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
