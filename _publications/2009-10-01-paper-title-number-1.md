excerpt: 'With the rapid growth of wind power capacity, fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of wind turbines (WT) have become increasingly important. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a key technology in this field, showing strong potential but still facing notable challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of ML-based fault diagnosis methods for WTs, covering both theoretical foundations and industrial applications. The discussion spans traditional machine learning (TML), artificial neural networks (ANN), deep learning (DL), and transfer learning (TL), highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. A distribution diagram illustrates the application landscape, while current challenges and future research directions are also outlined.'
